# Predict_Blood_Donations

Welcome to the Predict_Blood_Donations project repository! This project is an internship project at MedTourEasy focused on predicting blood donations.

## Description

The Predict_Blood_Donations project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast whether a blood donor will donate blood in the future based on certain factors. The project involves analyzing historical data, performing data preprocessing, and building a machine learning model for predictions.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing: The project includes data collection from various sources and cleaning the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain insights and understand the relationships between variables.
- Feature engineering: Create new features from existing data to improve the model's performance.
- Model development: Build a machine learning model using appropriate algorithms and techniques to predict blood donations.
- Model evaluation: Assess the performance of the developed model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
- Documentation: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the code, data, and analysis process.
